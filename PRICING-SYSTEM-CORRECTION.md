# 🎯 IMPORTANT: Pricing System Correction

**Date:** October 9, 2025

## ⚠️ **Critical Discovery:**

While implementing a new `pricing_config` table, I discovered your database **already has** a comprehensive `video_pricing` table with completely different pricing values!

### **The Mismatch:**

| What I Created | What You Actually Have |
|----------------|------------------------|
| New `pricing_config` table | ✅ Existing `video_pricing` table |
| Base price: **100-150 credits** | Actual price: **20,000-70,000 credits** |
| Simple modifiers | 4 parameters (type, duration, resolution, quality) |

**Difference:** 200x-700x more expensive than my initial implementation!

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Deleted:** 
   - `pricing_config` migration file (not needed)
   - Old `pricing.ts` (referenced wrong table)
   - Old `admin.ts` (referenced wrong table)

2. **Created New:**
   - `pricing.ts` - Now queries existing `video_pricing` table
   - `admin.ts` - Admin functions for `video_pricing` table
   - `show-pricing.mjs` - Script to view current pricing

3. **Updated:**
   - Documentation to reflect correct pricing structure

---

## 📊 **Your Actual Pricing:**

```
text_to_video    | 5s  | 1280x720   | standard =  20,000 credits
text_to_video    | 5s  | 1920x1080  | high     =  30,000 credits (DEFAULT)
text_to_video    | 10s | 1280x720   | standard =  36,000 credits
text_to_video    | 10s | 1920x1080  | high     =  50,000 credits

image_to_video   | 5s  | 1280x720   | standard =  30,000 credits
image_to_video   | 5s  | 1920x1080  | high     =  40,000 credits (DEFAULT)
image_to_video   | 10s | 1280x720   | standard =  50,000 credits
image_to_video   | 10s | 1920x1080  | high     =  70,000 credits
```

## 🎯 **Current Implementation:**

### **Dashboard Default:**
- Uses: Full HD (1920x1080), High Quality
- Cost: **30,000 credits** per text-to-video (5s)

### **How It Works:**
```typescript
// In video.ts:
const creditsNeeded = await calculateVideoPrice({
  type: 'text_to_video',
  duration: '5s',
  resolution: '1920x1080',  // Full HD
  quality: 'high'            // High quality
});
// Returns: 30,000 credits from video_pricing table
```

## 💡 **Key Features:**

✅ **Database-driven:** Prices stored in `video_pricing` table  
✅ **Flexible:** Change prices anytime via Supabase dashboard  
✅ **Cached:** 5-minute in-memory cache for performance  
✅ **No migration needed:** Table already exists  
✅ **Production ready:** Can change prices without redeploying

## 📝 **How to Change Pricing:**

### **Quick Method (Supabase Dashboard):**

1. Open Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor
2. Find `video_pricing` table
3. Edit `credits_cost` column for any row
4. Save
5. Wait 5 minutes (cache refresh) or restart server

### **SQL Method:**

```sql
UPDATE video_pricing 
SET credits_cost = 25000 
WHERE video_type = 'text_to_video' 
  AND duration_seconds = 5 
  AND resolution = '1920x1080' 
  AND quality = 'high';
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing:**

```bash
# View current pricing
node show-pricing.mjs

# Restart dev server to clear cache
# (TypeScript may need cache refresh)
npm run dev
```
