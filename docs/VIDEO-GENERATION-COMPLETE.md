## 🎯 Architecture Overview

### Video Storage Strategy: **CDN-Based (Optimized)**

We **DO NOT** store videos on our servers. Instead:

1. **Third-party API** generates video and hosts on their CDN
2. **We store** only metadata and CDN URL in database
3. **Users watch/download** directly from third-party CDN

### Benefits:
- ✅ **Zero storage costs**
- ✅ **Zero bandwidth costs**
- ✅ **Faster video delivery** (optimized CDN)
- ✅ **Infinite scalability**
- ✅ **Minimal database usage**

---

## 📊 Credit System Flow

### Video Creation:
1. Check: User has ≥ 100 credits ✅
2. Call third-party API to create task
3. Deduct: 100 credits immediately
4. Create transaction record (type: 'video_generation')
5. Store video metadata with status='pending'

### Video Success:
1. Webhook receives success callback
2. Extract video URL from response
3. Update status to 'completed'
4. No credit changes

### Video Failure:
1. Webhook receives failure callback
2. Update status to 'failed'
3. Refund: 100 credits back to user ✅
4. Create refund transaction
5. Store error message

---

## 🔄 Real-Time Updates (Two Methods)

### Method 1: Webhook (Primary)
- Third-party API sends POST to `/api/video-callback`
- Instant updates when video completes
- Most reliable and efficient

### Method 2: Client Polling (Fallback)
- Frontend polls `queryVideoStatus` every 5 seconds
- Only for videos in 'pending' or 'processing' state
- Ensures updates even if webhook fails
- Automatically stops when video completes

---



✅ **All environment variables are configured**

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Prerequisites:
1. ✅ Development server running (`npm run dev`)
2. ✅ User account with credits (≥ 100)
3. ✅ Internet connection (for API calls)

### Test Steps:

#### **Test 1: Create Video (Success Path)**

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. Login with a user account
3. Check that credit balance is displayed in header
4. Enter a video prompt (e.g., "A professor giving a lecture in a classroom")
5. Select aspect ratio (landscape or portrait)
6. Click submit button
7. **Expected:**
   - Video appears in gallery with "Chờ xử lý" badge
   - Credits reduced by 100
   - Success alert: "Video đang được tạo! Vui lòng đợi..."
   - Loading spinner with 10% progress

#### **Test 2: Status Polling**

1. Wait 5-10 seconds after video creation
2. **Expected:**
   - Badge changes to "Đang xử lý"
   - Progress updates to 50%
   - Polling continues every 5 seconds

#### **Test 3: Video Completion**

1. Wait for video to complete (varies by API)
2. **Expected:**
   - Badge changes to "✓ Hoàn thành"
   - Video player appears with playable video
   - Hover shows download and delete buttons
   - Polling stops

#### **Test 4: Download Video**

1. Hover over completed video
2. Click download button
3. **Expected:**
   - Browser downloads video file
   - Filename based on prompt

#### **Test 5: Delete Video**

1. Hover over video
2. Click delete button
3. Confirm deletion
4. **Expected:**
   - Confirmation dialog appears
   - Video removed from gallery
   - Success alert: "Đã xóa video"

#### **Test 6: Insufficient Credits**

1. Ensure user has < 100 credits
2. Try to create video
3. **Expected:**
   - Submit button disabled
   - Hover shows tooltip: "Cần 100 credits"

#### **Test 7: Credit Refund (Failure)**

1. Create a video that will fail (or force failure in webhook)
2. **Expected:**
   - Badge changes to "✗ Thất bại"
   - Error message displayed
   - 100 credits refunded to user
   - Transaction record created

#### **Test 8: Webhook Callback**

1. Create a video
2. Check server logs for webhook POST
3. **Expected:**
   - Log: "Received video callback: {data}"
   - Video status updated in database
   - Video URL extracted and stored

- [ ] Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to production domain
- [ ] Test webhook callback from production URL
- [ ] Set up monitoring for failed videos
- [ ] Configure error alerting (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] Test credit refund flow thoroughly
- [ ] Verify video CDN URLs are accessible publicly
- [ ] Set up rate limiting for video creation
- [ ] Add content moderation for prompts

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Video stuck in "pending" state

**Possible Causes:**
1. Webhook callback failed
2. Third-party API down

**Solution:**
- Client polling will continue to check status
- Manually check API status with `queryVideoStatus`
- Check server logs for webhook errors

### Issue: Credits not refunded on failure

**Possible Causes:**
1. Webhook callback not received
2. Error in refund logic

**Solution:**
- Check `transactions` table for refund record
- Check server logs for webhook callback
- Manually trigger refund if needed

### Issue: Video URL not playing

**Possible Causes:**
1. CDN URL expired
2. CORS issues
3. Invalid URL format

**Solution:**
- Check `resultJson` in database
- Verify URL is accessible in browser
- Check third-party API documentation
