# Video Not Showing in Dashboard - RESOLVED ✅

**Date:** October 9, 2025  
**Issue:** Video created on API provider but not showing in dashboard  
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

---

## 🔍 **Problem:**

You created a video on the Kie AI API provider's website and could see it there, but it wasn't showing up in your application's dashboard. The dashboard showed: **"Chưa có video nào"** (No videos yet).

---

## 🎯 **Root Cause:**

The video was created **directly through the API provider's interface** (not through your app), so it was never saved to your application's database.

**Key findings:**
1. ✅ Video exists on API provider: `https://tempfile.aiquickdraw.com/f/f826930313f43b95efd5d69f98ac4425/a5ab88e5-15a9-47ab-800b-86738be41736.mp4`
2. ❌ Video NOT in your database (videos table was empty)
3. ❌ Callback URL issue: Used `localhost:3000` but server is on `localhost:3001`
4. ❌ Localhost callbacks don't work anyway (API provider can't reach localhost)

---

## ✅ **Solution Applied:**

### 1. **Manually Added Video to Database**

Created and ran `add-video-manual.mjs` script to import the video:

```javascript
// Video details
User ID: 7d0db514-1fba-4678-b0ae-d383b529ab76
Prompt: "tạo cho tôi video 1 con chó ở sau vườn..."
Status: completed (100%)
Video URL: https://tempfile.aiquickdraw.com/f/.../a5ab88e5-15a9-47ab-800b-86738be41736.mp4
Credits Used: 100
```

**Result:** ✅ Video successfully added to database

### 2. **Fixed Transaction Type Enum**

**Error found:** 
```
invalid input value for enum transaction_type: "video_generation"
```

**Fix applied:**
- Changed `'video_generation'` → `'video_deduction'` in:
  - `src/lib/actions/video.ts` (line 198)
  - `add-video-manual.mjs`

**Correct enum values:**
- `purchase` - Credit purchases
- `video_deduction` - Video generation costs
- `refund` - Failed video refunds
- `bonus` - Promotional credits

## 🚨 **Important: Webhook Callback Issue**

### **The Problem:**

Your callback URL is set to:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/video-callback
```

**Issues:**
1. ❌ Server is running on port **3001**, not 3000
2. ❌ `localhost` is not accessible from the internet
3. ❌ API provider cannot send webhook callbacks to localhost

### **Why This Matters:**

When you create a video through your app:
1. App calls API to create video
2. Video is saved to your database with `status='pending'`
3. API generates video (takes time)
4. API tries to send webhook to callback URL → **FAILS** (can't reach localhost)
5. Your app relies on **client-side polling** to check status (every 5 seconds)

**Current situation:** Client-side polling will work, but webhooks won't. This means status updates are slower (5-second delay) instead of instant.

---

## 🚀 **Proper Solution: Deploy Your App**

To get webhooks working properly, you need to **deploy your app** to a public URL.

### **Recommended Deployment: Vercel**

1. **Install Vercel CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy:**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Update Environment Variables:**
   After deployment, update `.env.local` in Vercel dashboard:
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
   ```

4. **Benefits:**
   - ✅ Public callback URL works
   - ✅ Instant webhook notifications
   - ✅ No more port conflicts
   - ✅ Faster status updates
   - ✅ Production-ready

### **Alternative: Use Polling Only (Development)**

For local development, just rely on client-side polling:
- Status updates every 5 seconds
- No webhooks needed
- Works perfectly for testing

## 📊 **Current Database State:**

```
👥 Users: 2
  - User 1: 0 credits, 0 videos
  - User 2: 100,000 credits, 1 video ✅

🎥 Videos: 1 ✅
  - Status: completed
  - Prompt: "tạo cho tôi video 1 con chó..."
  - URL: Available
  - Progress: 100%

💰 Transactions: 0
  (Transaction creation failed due to enum error, now fixed)
```

---

## ✅ **Verification Steps:**

1. **Refresh your dashboard:**
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard
   - Login with user: `7d0db514-1fba-4678-b0ae-d383b529ab76`
   - You should see **1 video** with the dog in the Vietnamese countryside

2. **Test video playback:**
   - Video should play inline in the dashboard
   - Download button should work
   - Delete button should work

3. **Verify video URL:**
   ```bash
   node check-videos.mjs
   ```
   Should show 1 video with status "completed"

## 🧪 **How to Create Videos Properly Going Forward:**

### **Method 1: Through Your App (Recommended)**

1. Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard
2. Enter a video prompt
3. Select aspect ratio
4. Click submit

**What happens:**
- ✅ Credits deducted from your account
- ✅ Video saved to database immediately (status: pending)
- ✅ Appears in dashboard right away
- ✅ Status updates via polling every 5 seconds
- ✅ Transaction recorded

### **Method 2: Through API Provider Website**

If you create videos directly on Kie AI website:
- ❌ NOT saved to your database
- ❌ WON'T appear in your dashboard
- ❌ Need to manually import using script

**To import manually:**
1. Edit `add-video-manual.mjs` with video details
2. Run: `node add-video-manual.mjs`
3. Refresh dashboard

---

## 🔧 **API Provider Status:**

Current API quota status:
```
Error Code: 402
Message: "The current credits are insufficient. Please top up."
```

**Actions needed:**
1. Top up credits on Kie AI account
2. Or wait for quota reset
3. Or get new API key

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

1. **Always use your app** to create videos (not API provider's interface)
2. **Deploy to production** for webhooks to work
3. **Monitor API quota** to avoid hitting limits
4. **Check database** with `check-videos.mjs` if videos don't appear
5. **Port 3001** is your current dev server (not 3000)
