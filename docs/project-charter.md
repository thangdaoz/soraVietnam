# Project Charter: Sora Vietnam Gateway

## 1. Executive Summary

This project, "Sora Vietnam Gateway," aims to provide creative professionals, marketers, and general users in Vietnam with localized access to state-of-the-art text-to-video and image-to-video AI generation. The recently released Sora 2 model by OpenAI is currently available on a limited basis, primarily in the U.S. and Canada, with no clear timeline for a rollout in Vietnam. This creates a significant market opportunity. Our solution will be a web-based platform that integrates with a third-party API providing access to a comparable high-quality video generation model. The service will be offered on a flexible, transparent pay-as-you-go basis, making advanced creative AI tools accessible to the Vietnamese market. The AI market in Vietnam is experiencing rapid growth, with over 89% of businesses already incorporating AI into their marketing strategies, indicating a strong demand for innovative tools.

## 2. Project Goals and Objectives

### 2.1. Business Goals

- **Market Entry:** To become the leading and most trusted provider of generative AI video services in Vietnam.
- **Monetization:** To establish a profitable and scalable pay-as-you-go revenue model.
- **User Acquisition:** To acquire a significant user base of content creators, marketing agencies, and businesses within the first year of operation.

### 2.2. Project Objectives (SMART)

- **Specific:** Develop and launch a fully functional web platform enabling users to generate high-definition video from text and image prompts.
- **Measurable:**
  - Onboard 10,000 active users within the first six months post-launch.
  - Process over 50,000 video generation jobs within the first year.
  - Achieve a customer satisfaction (CSAT) score of 85% or higher.
- **Achievable:** By leveraging a pre-existing third-party API, the core technical challenge shifts from model development to platform engineering, which is a highly achievable goal.
- **Relevant:** The project directly addresses the current unavailability of premier AI video tools in Vietnam, a market with a high adoption rate of AI in the creative and marketing sectors.
- **Time-bound:** The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is to be launched within a 6-month timeframe from the project start date.

## 3. Business Case & Justification

The demand for video content is immense, and the creative industry in Vietnam is rapidly adopting AI to enhance production and storytelling. However, access to cutting-edge models like Sora 2 is geographically restricted. This project bridges that gap. By providing a localized platform with a pay-as-you-go model, we lower the barrier to entry for freelancers, small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), and even large corporations who want to leverage generative video without committing to expensive, complex international services. The global AI video generator market was valued at over USD 550 million in 2023 and is projected to grow significantly, highlighting the substantial financial opportunity.

## 4. Scope

### 4.1. In-Scope

- **User Platform:** A secure, user-friendly web application accessible on desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Core Functionality:**
  - Text-to-Video Generation.
  - Image-to-Video Generation.
- **User Account Management:** Secure user registration, login, profile management, and a dashboard to view and manage generated videos.
- **Third-Party API Integration:** Seamless and reliable integration with a selected video generation API (e.g., services that provide models like Google Veo, Luma Labs Dream Machine, or others).
- **Billing System:** An integrated pay-as-you-go system, allowing users to purchase credits and view their usage history. Pricing will be competitive, potentially based on video duration or generation complexity.
- **Localization:** The entire user interface and user support will be in Vietnamese.

| **API Provider** | [To Be Determined] | Provides the core video generation technology. |

## 6. High-Level Risks and Assumptions

### 6.1. Assumptions

- A reliable and high-quality third-party text-to-video API is available for commercial integration.
- The chosen API provider will have scalable infrastructure to handle our user demand.
- The pay-as-you-go model will be attractive to the target market in Vietnam.
- There will be no regulatory hurdles in Vietnam for providing this type of AI service.

### 6.2. Risks

| Risk ID | Description                                                                   | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                         |

| R-01    | **Dependency:** Third-party API service becomes unreliable or discontinues.   | Medium      | High   | Vet multiple API providers. Design the system with a modular API connector to facilitate switching providers.               |
| R-02    | **Competition:** OpenAI or a major competitor officially launches in Vietnam. | Medium      | High   | Build strong brand loyalty through superior customer service, community features, and a user-friendly platform.             |
| R-03    | **Cost:** API usage costs are higher than projected, impacting profitability. | Medium      | Medium | Implement tiered pricing. Secure volume discounts with the API provider. Continuously monitor and optimize usage.           |
| R-04    | **Technical:** Difficulties in integrating the payment gateway or API.        | Low         | Medium | Allocate sufficient time for integration testing. Choose well-documented and widely-used provider services.                 |
| R-05    | **Ethical:** Users generate inappropriate or harmful content.                 | High        | High   | Implement strict content moderation policies and use AI-based filters provided by the API. Clearly define terms of service. |
