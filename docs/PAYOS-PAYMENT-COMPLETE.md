## 🔒 Security Implementation

### Multi-Layer Security:

1. **Webhook Signature Verification**
   - Every webhook is verified using PayOS checksum key
   - Invalid signatures are rejected (400 Bad Request)

2. **Idempotency**
   - Checks if transaction already processed
   - Prevents duplicate credit grants
   - Returns 200 OK with "already processed" message

3. **Authentication**
   - All server actions require user authentication
   - Supabase RLS policies enforce data access control

4. **Service Role for Webhooks**
   - Webhook uses service role key
   - Bypasses RLS for admin operations
   - Ensures atomic updates

5. **Transaction Validation**
   - Order codes are checked against database
   - 404 returned if order not found
   - User ownership verified

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Webhook not received

**Possible Causes:**
1. Webhook URL not registered in PayOS Dashboard
2. Firewall blocking PayOS IP
3. HTTPS not enabled (production requirement)

**Solution:**
- Check PayOS Dashboard → Webhooks
- Use ngrok for local testing: `ngrok http 3000`
- Register ngrok URL as webhook temporarily

### Issue: Credits not added after payment

**Possible Causes:**
1. Webhook signature verification failed
2. Transaction already processed
3. Database RLS policy blocking update

**Solution:**
- Check server logs for webhook errors
- Verify `PAYOS_CHECKSUM_KEY` is correct
- Check Supabase logs for RLS denials
- Use service role key for webhook operations

### Issue: Payment link creation fails

**Possible Causes:**
1. Invalid PayOS credentials
2. PayOS API down
3. Network timeout

**Solution:**
- Verify all 3 PayOS env variables are set
- Check PayOS API status page
- Review error message in browser console
- Test API credentials directly
