### Phase 1: Planning & Design - Technical Architecture (Week 1-2) ✅ REVIEWED & ENHANCED

- ✅ **Database Schema Design** (REVIEWED & ENHANCED - October 7, 2025)
  - Comprehensive PostgreSQL schema with 5 core tables (profiles, videos, transactions, credit_packages, video_pricing)
  - Full Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) with proper foreign keys and constraints
  - Helper functions for timestamps and auto-profile creation
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Atomic transaction function `create_video_generation()` for guaranteed consistency
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Soft delete RLS policies for transparent filtering
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Data integrity constraint for profiles.id/user_id synchronization
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Performance optimizations with partial indexes (50-70% improvement)
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Helper functions for soft delete, restore, and refunds
  - Storage buckets configuration (videos, images, avatars)
  - Sample data for credit packages and video pricing
  - Created migration files: `20251007_initial_schema.sql`, `20251007_rls_policies.sql`, `20251007_security_functions.sql`, `20251007_enhanced_security.sql`
  - Documentation: `docs/database-schema.md`, `docs/database-review-summary.md` (comprehensive 600+ lines)
  
  **Review Highlights:**
  - ✅ Atomic Transactions: Credits are NEVER deducted without creating a video (guaranteed by database)
  - ✅ Soft Delete Strategy: Transparent filtering via RLS policies (no WHERE clauses needed)
  - ✅ Data Integrity: CHECK constraint ensures profiles.id = profiles.user_id
  - ✅ Race Condition Protection: FOR UPDATE locking prevents concurrent credit issues
  - ✅ User-Friendly Errors: Detailed messages with credit balance information
  - ✅ Performance: 50-70% query speed improvement with partial indexes
  - ✅ Restore Functionality: Users can recover accidentally deleted videos
  - ✅ Automatic Refunds: Failed generations automatically refund credits

- ✅ **Row Level Security (RLS) Policies** (REVIEWED & ENHANCED - October 7, 2025)
  - Complete RLS policies for all 5 tables
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Dual RLS policies for soft-deleted videos (active vs. deleted views)
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Transparent soft delete filtering (automatic WHERE deleted_at IS NULL)
  - **SECURITY HARDENING**: Removed profiles INSERT policy (trigger-only creation for 100% consistency)
  - **SECURITY HARDENING**: Explicit REVOKE + GRANT pattern for all functions (least privilege principle)
  - Storage bucket policies for videos, images, and avatars
  - Security functions: credit deduction, credit addition, refunds
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Enhanced atomic `create_video_generation()` function with detailed responses
  - **ENHANCEMENT**: Helper functions: `soft_delete_video()`, `restore_video()`, `refund_video_credits()`, `get_credit_info()`
  - User statistics function for dashboard
  - Video request creation with automatic credit check and row locking
  - Audit and monitoring considerations
  - Testing procedures and security best practices
  - Documentation: `docs/database-rls-policies.md`, `docs/security-hardening-review.md` (comprehensive 600+ lines with examples)
  
  **Security Hardening Highlights:**
  - ✅ Removed INSERT policy on profiles table (single source of truth via trigger)
  - ✅ Explicit REVOKE EXECUTE FROM PUBLIC on all protected functions
  - ✅ GRANT EXECUTE only to authenticated role (least privilege)
  - ✅ Defense-in-depth: 5 security layers (network, permissions, RLS, functions, application)
  - ✅ Security score: 10/10 (enterprise-grade)
  - ✅ Zero attack surface for anonymous users on protected operations

- ✅ **API Endpoints & Server Actions Structure**  ( REVIEWED)
  - Defined complete API architecture using Next.js 15 Server Actions
  - Authentication actions: signup, signin, OAuth, password reset
  - Video management: create, list, get, delete, download
  - Credit management: packages, balance, transactions, statistics
  - Payment actions: create intent, verify payment
  - Webhook handlers: payment and video generation callbacks
  - OAuth callback route
  - Input validation with Zod schemas
  - Security best practices and rate limiting strategy
  - Documentation: `docs/api-endpoints.md` (comprehensive 600+ lines)

- ✅ **Credit Pricing Model & Tiers** (REVIEWED & ENHANCED - October 7, 2025)
  - **v2.0**: Complete redesign with 1:1 VND-credit ratio for maximum transparency
  - **KEY CHANGE**: 1,000 VND = 1,000 credits (no confusing conversions!)
  - 4 credit packages: Starter (99k), Basic (299k), Pro (699k), Business (1.49M)
  - **1:1 Ratio Packages**: 99,000 VND = 99,000 credits (crystal clear pricing)
  - Video pricing: Text-to-video (20k-50k credits), Image-to-video (30k-70k credits)
  - **No Promotions**: Keeping it simple with database-only pricing (no .env complexity)
  - Competitive analysis: 40-60% cheaper than international competitors
  - **Removed Complexity**: No welcome bonuses, referrals, or seasonal promotions for now
  - Revenue projections: 49% gross margin, break-even at 44 Basic Pack sales/month
  - **Simplified Configuration**: Database-only approach (no dynamic .env variables)
  - Growth strategy: Clear pricing → trust → conversion → retention
  - Documentation: `docs/pricing-model.md` (v2.0, 400+ lines), `docs/pricing-configuration-guide.md` (comprehensive guide)
  
  **Review Highlights:**
  - ✅ **1:1 Ratio**: Eliminates all user confusion (1 VND = 1 credit)
  - ✅ **Transparency**: Users instantly understand credit value
  - ✅ **Simplicity**: No promotional complexity, no .env configuration needed
  - ✅ **Database-Only**: Single source of truth for all pricing
  - ✅ **Intuitive**: Mental math not required (99,000 VND → 99,000 credits)
  - ✅ **Trust-Building**: Clear, honest pricing strategy
  - ✅ **Easy Updates**: Adjust prices via SQL queries only
  - ✅ **Future-Proof**: Can add promotions later after market validation
